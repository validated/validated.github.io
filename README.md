# Tool

We are the anonymous group of unelected localists. In order to resist the tyranny of the World Tequila Forum (WTF), the unconstitutional and immoral mandates of tequila shots, and digital certificates of tequila consumption, we introduced the open-source online tool. The tool allows everyone to create, customize, share and download the digital certificates of tequila consumption. The tool has been made mainly for people who do not like tequila or consider that alcohol consumption is harmful to health. But the tool is non-discriminatory, and everyone can use it, regardless of language spoken, nationality, citizenship, or opinions about tequila consumption.
